							<h2>Hamza Latif</h2>
							<p> I'm an MSc Data Science student at King's College London, with a first-class Computer Science degree from City, University of London.</p>
							<p> I specialize in Python, machine learning, and data analysis, with hands-on experience extracting insights from large datasets. </p>
							<p>	Alongside my data science focus, I have a strong foundation in software engineering, proficient in Java, Python, and C++. I'm passionate about both back-end and front-end development, constantly aiming to enhance my skills and contribute as a software engineer. </p>
							<p>	 This portfolio showcases some of my work and projects, where I've applied my technical knowledge to solve complex challenges. </p>

									<h2 class="major">Deepfake Detection Model</h2>
									<p>Developed a deepfake detection model that classifies facial images as either ‘real’, ‘deepfake’, or ‘faceswap’. The project involved constructing several ResNet models and improving on previous testing using the FaceForensics++ dataset. As part of the development, I built a Python GUI application where users can select a model, upload an image, and view the model's prediction. This project was developed in Python, with the models trained and tested using Google Colab Pro, and the dataset accessed via Google Drive. The GUI application was created using Python and the PyCharm IDE. Key libraries used in the project include TensorFlow, NumPy, Matplotlib, PyTorch, and Tkinter. One of the most challenging aspects was ensuring model accuracy and usability through continuous testing and iteration, balancing the development of both the detection models and the GUI interface.</p>

										<h2 class="major">AirVia Ltd</h2>
										<p> Developed a software prototype for AirVia Ltd. that streamlined ticket sales, tracked sales records for a travel agency, and generated financial reports required by the company’s Financial Department. The project was a collaborative effort where my primary role was as a developer. I contributed to both the design and implementation of the GUI using Java Swing, working closely with another team member. Additionally, I was responsible for the functionality of the system, including navigation, database connectivity, and data manipulation. The database was hosted on a private server, and I used the MySQL connector to integrate the program with the database. One of the most challenging aspects of the project was ensuring code reliability through continuous testing, which often took more time than the actual development process. </p>

										<h2 class="major">2D Shooting Game</h2>
										<p> Developed a 2D platformer game using the CityEngine, a wrapper around the JBox2D physics engine. The game features a main menu that allows users to start a new game, load a saved game, adjust settings, or exit. There are four distinct levels, each with its own theme, controls, and objectives. The primary goal is to collect coins and defeat enemies, with the ability to pause and save progress at any time. Players can utilise three quick-save slots or manually choose save locations, and games can be reloaded from the main menu. The settings menu includes options to adjust or mute the volume and toggle the display of controls and objectives. Each level introduces unique enemies, varying in appearance and attack patterns—some slow the player down, while others shoot in bursts. In-game, character stats such as collected coins and health are displayed, and progression to the next level is achieved by completing all objectives and passing through a portal. </p>

										<h2 class="major">Pacman 1.1</h2>
										<p> Developed a game inspired by Pacman, showcasing the use of arrays, loops, classes, and objects. The game begins with a menu screen displaying rules and information, and users can start by pressing the spacebar. The core elements of the game—Pacman, ghosts, and food—are each represented by their own class with unique attributes. The initial positions of the ghosts and food are randomly generated and stored in a 2D array. Different types of food provide various effects, such as red food adding 1 point, blue food adding 10 points, and the Boost item increasing Pacman’s speed. Ghosts have randomised movement speeds and colors each game, with a bouncing effect, while Pacman can move through the canvas borders. The game displays time and score at the bottom of the screen, and the objective is to avoid the ghosts while collecting food. If Pacman collides with a ghost, the game ends. Reaching 300 points results in a win, and the final screen shows victory or loss along with the player's time and score. To exit, the user clicks anywhere on the canvas. </p>
